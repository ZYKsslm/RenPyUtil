The game/libs/ directory is meant for third-party libraries that ask to be
put in game/libs.

When this file (game/libs/libs.txt) is present, Ren'Py will load all files
in libs before any other file in game/, and will ignore the first directory
name under game/libs when determining the order to load files.
